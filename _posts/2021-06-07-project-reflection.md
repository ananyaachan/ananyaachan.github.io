This is a post reflecting on my Opinion Dynamics Visualization Project. 

I worked on #1 and #4 with my great teammate, Tiana Cui.

### 1. Overall, what did you achieve in your project?

  We successfully created interactive and attractive visualizations on three opinion dynamics models. Our end product was a program in which the user can input their own data for a network, choose an opinion dynamics model, and input the parameters they’d like. So the user can play around with the visualizations to see how different kinds of models behave and also look at the effects of changing parameters.

### 2. What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of?

  - I’m proud of the fact that we were able to learn how different tools of a new library, Bokeh, works and used it to successfully implement opinion dynamics models that we had never heard of before. 
  - We were initially struggling to create a visualization that changes with time and was compatible with the Bokeh library so we started off by creating gifs. After more research and reading, we were able to optimize and make this more efficient, by figuring out how to use widgets instead.

### 3. What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project?

  - We could increase the complexity of our models in order to include more factors that affect opinion dynamics models such as the environment of the network.
  - We could host the program on a webapp or from the command line instead of Jupyter Notebook so that users can access the program more easily.

### 4. How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal?

  We achieved most of the things we wanted — we implemented an update method for all three models, we had dropdown menus and sliders for adjusting parameters, and we had a time slider that can be incremented both automatically and manually. The only thing that we didn’t do and wish we could have done is to move our end product into a web application. Unfortunately we weren’t able to find a good way to transfer all of our widgets to a webapp.

### 5. What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project?

  - I taught myself important functions of the Bokeh library in Python. The learning experience involved a lot of trial and error and taught me how to read and understand online code documentation by myself better.
  - I had never got the opportunity to use GitHub for collaborating on a project, so this project has definitely made me more comfortable with it.
  - I learnt how to use Ipywidgets in Python which taught me about user interface in Jupyter, specifically how we can enable users to  upload data and explore the models using widgets.


### 6. How will your experience completing this project help you in your future studies or career?

  Firstly, this experience enhanced my planning skills for a long-term task. It was important to break down our project into short term tasks first and update our long-term goal based on our progress. I think this is an important skill for my career where I would have to handle long term goals so this was a great experience to learn how to manage a bigger project. Moreover, the concepts I learnt about opinion dynamics were really interesting and are going to be really valuable in my career as I step into a performance marketing internship. It is fascinating to see how social networks function and will be really useful for my internship. Lastly, this experience has also enhanced my independent learning skills. Extensive reading on the opinion dynamics models and code documentations have been beneficial for me as they made me perseverant and patient while completing a task.
