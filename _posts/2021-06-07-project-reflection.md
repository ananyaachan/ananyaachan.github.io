This is a post reflecting on the Opinion Dynamics Visualization Project that I worked on with Tiana Cui.

- Overall, what did you achieve in your project? (Ananya)

  We successfully created interactive and attractive visualizations on three opinion dynamics models. Our end product was a program in which the user can input their own data for a network, choose an opinion dynamics model, and input the parameters they’d like. So the user can play around with the visualizations to see how different kinds of models behave and also look at the effects of changing parameters.

- What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? (Ananya)

  1. I’m proud of the fact that we were able to learn how different tools of a new library, Bokeh, works and used it to successfully implement opinion dynamics models that we had never heard of before. 
  2. We were initially struggling to create a visualization that changes with time and was compatible with the Bokeh library so we started off by creating gifs. After more research and reading, we were able to optimize and make this more efficient, by figuring out how to use widgets instead.

- What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project? (Ananya)

  1. We could increase the complexity of our models in order to include more factors that affect opinion dynamics models such as the environment of the network.
  2. We could host the program on a webapp or from the command line instead of Jupyter Notebook so that users can access the program more easily.

- How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? (Tiana)

  We actually achieved most of the things we had in mind — we implemented an update method for all three models, we had dropdown menus and sliders for adjusting parameters, and we had a time slider that can be incremented both automatically and manually. The only thing that we didn’t do and wish we could have done is to move our end product into a web application. Unfortunately we weren’t able to find a good way to transfer all of our widgets to a webapp, which is kind of a shame.

- What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? Data analysis techniques? Python packages? Git + GitHub? Etc?

- How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? Please be as specific as possible.
