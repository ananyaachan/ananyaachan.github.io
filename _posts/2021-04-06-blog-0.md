title: Visualization - Palmer Penguins

This post is a tutorial explaining how to visualize the correlation between Culmen Length and Flipper Length according to the Islands category in the Palmer Penguins dataset.

## Tutorial
1. We need pandas and seaborn to create this visualization so our first step is to import both of them. Then we read the Palmer Penguins dataset into a dataframe called penguins using the read_csv function in pandas.


    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import seaborn as sns
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
    penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
    ```

2. Our next step is to have a look at the penguins dataframe, and we use the code below to display the first 5 rows.


    ```python
    penguins.head()
    ```

3. Next we need to create our visualization. We want to see the correlation between Flipper Length and Culmen Length in the different islands. 

    We use seaborn's lmplot to create this visualization. lmplot is used to create a scatter plot to see the correlation between two numerical variables. 

    - The first paramater is the x variable (Culmen Length) and the second parameter is the y variable (Flipper Length).     
    - The data parameter is to specify the dataframe which has x and y as columns i.e. penguins.     
    - Next, hue is used to specify which column of the dataframe needs to be used to color encode the data points, and since we want to see the correlation in the different islands, we set this parameter as "Island".    
    - Using the palette parameter, we use the seaborn color pallette Set2 and the first three colors of this palette will be used by default to color encode the three different islands.  
    - The fit_reg parameter is used to create regression line for the correlation but we set this as false since we want to compare correlations in the islands and adding a regression line for each island might reduce the readability of this plot.        
    - We specify the height and aspect of the seaborn plot in order to clearly display it.


    ```python
    sns.lmplot('Culmen Length (mm)', 'Flipper Length (mm)', data=penguins, hue='Island', palette = sns.color_palette("Set2"), fit_reg=False, height=7.27, aspect=9.7/8.27)
    ```
