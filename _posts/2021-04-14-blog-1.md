Creating interactive data graphics using the NOAA climate dataset.

### §1. Create a Database

We will use sqlite3 in python to create our database, this makes the use of commands written in SQL.
```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
```

We create a connection to a database called temps.db. If the database doesn't exist, then it is created.
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
```

Now we need to clean the dataframe by making use of stacking as in the function below. The input dataframe with a column for each month, is repaced with a stacked up version of itself with a new column defining what month it is and another column with the corresponding temp at that month.
```python
def prepare_df(df):
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"])
    df = df.stack()
    df = df.reset_index()
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100
    return(df)
```

We read the temperatures dataset into python using chunksize since the dataset is very large and we populate our dataset as a table in our database using to_sql.
```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000)
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df)
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False)
```

We read in data on the stations into python.
```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url)
stations["FIPS"] = stations["ID"].str[0:2]
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

We read in data on the countries into python.
```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(url)
countries = countries.rename(columns={'FIPS 10-4':'FIPS', 'Name': 'Country'})
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
```

```python
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")

for result in cursor.fetchall():
    print(result[0])
```

    CREATE TABLE "temperatures" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "Year" INTEGER,
      "Month" INTEGER,
      "Temp" REAL
    )
    CREATE TABLE "stations" (
    "ID" TEXT,
      "LATITUDE" REAL,
      "LONGITUDE" REAL,
      "STNELEV" REAL,
      "NAME" TEXT,
      "FIPS" TEXT
    )
    CREATE TABLE "countries" (
    "FIPS" TEXT,
      "ISO 3166" TEXT,
      "Country" TEXT
    )

We can see that the three tables are in our database, we can also view the columns for each of our tables.



It is good practice to close the connection to the database at the end.
```python
conn.close()
```

### §2. Write a Query Function

We query the temps database in order to get a dataframe with the columns for:
- The station name.
- The latitude of the station.
- The longitude of the station.
- The name of the country in which the station is located.
- The year in which the reading was taken.
- The month in which the reading was taken.
- The average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month. (Note: the temperatures in the raw data are already averages by month, so you don’t have to do any aggregation at this stage.)

```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    command = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.NAME, S.LATITUDE, S.LONGITUDE, C.Country, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp 
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.FIPS = S.FIPS
    WHERE C.Country = "{country}"
    AND T.Year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end} 
    AND T.Month = {month}"""
    df = pd.read_sql_query(command, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df
```


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```

### §3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

We will address the following question:
#### How does the average yearly change in temperature vary within a given country?

We will use plotly in order to create interactive graphics in python. 
Plotly express has a function called scatter_mapbox which can be used to plot a location on a map based on its corresponding longitude and latitude. We can also color the map in a gradient associated with a numerical column in the dataframe, and customize data that is displayed when a data point is hovered over.
```python
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def coef(data_group):
        x = data_group[["Year"]] # 2 brackets because X should be a df
        y = data_group["Temp"]   # 1 bracket because y should be a series
        LR = LinearRegression()
        LR.fit(x, y)
        return LR.coef_[0]

def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    This function accepts five explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments.
    - country, year_begin, year_end, and month should be as in the previous part.
    - min_obs, the minimum required number of years of data for any given station.
    - **kwargs, additional keyword arguments passed to px.scatter_mapbox().
    """
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    df['obs'] = df.groupby(['NAME'])['Year'].transform('count')
    df = df[df['obs'] >= min_obs]   
    coefs = df.groupby(["NAME", "Month", "LATITUDE", "LONGITUDE"]).apply(coef)
    coefs = coefs.reset_index()
    coefs = coefs.rename(columns = {0  : "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})
    coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"] = coefs["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"].round(decimals=4)
    months = {1:'January', 2: 'February', 3: 'March', 4: 'April', 5:'May', 6:'June', 7:'July', 8:'August', 9:'September', 10:'October', 11:'November', 12:'December'} #for use in title, to displace the name in text of month instead of an int
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(coefs, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)",
                            hover_data = ["Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"],
                            title = f"Estimates of yearly increase in temperature in {months[month]} for stations in {country}, years {year_begin}-{year_end}",
                            **kwargs)
    return fig
```


```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r # choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()
```

{% include temperature_coefficient_plot.html %}

### §4. Create Two More Interesting Figures

#### First Figure

#### What is the comparison of percent change of average temperatures for each year in a specified range of years, between two countries at a certain month?

We query the database to output a dataframe with temperatures on the two countries in comparison, within the year range, on the specified month.
```python
def query_2(country_1, country_2, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    Outputs a dataframe with columns:
    - The name of the country in which the station is located.
    - The year in which the reading was taken.
    - The month in which the reading was taken.
    - The temperature reading.
    """
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    command = \
    f"""
    SELECT C.Country, T.Year, T.Month, T.Temp 
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.FIPS = S.FIPS
    WHERE T.Month = {month}
    AND (C.Country = "{country_1}" OR C.Country = "{country_2}")
    AND (T.Year BETWEEN {year_begin} AND {year_end}) 
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(command, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df
```


```python
import numpy as np
def percent_change_plot(country_1, country_2, year_begin, year_end, month):
    """
    Creates a lineplot for each country for the years: year_begin to year_end, showing the percent change in average temperature at each year.
    """
    df = query_2(country_1, country_2, year_begin, year_end, month) # query defined above to get the relevant dataframe
    avg_per_year = df.groupby(["Country", "Year", "Month"])['Temp'].aggregate(np.mean) # the average temp for each year for each country is calculated
    avg_per_year = avg_per_year.reset_index()
    pct_change_in_avg = avg_per_year.set_index(keys=["Country", "Year", "Month"])
    pct_change_in_avg = pct_change_in_avg.pct_change(periods=1) #calculates the percent change in temp from the immediately previous row 
    pct_change_in_avg = pct_change_in_avg.reset_index()
    pct_change_in_avg = pct_change_in_avg[pct_change_in_avg['Year'] != year_begin] # there is no percent change for the first year, since the data on temps before that is not in our dataframe, filter out the first year
    fig = px.line(data_frame = pct_change_in_avg, 
                 x = "Year", 
                 y = "Temp",
                 color = "Country",
                 )
    fig.update_layout(
    title={
        'text': f"Percent change in average temperature of a year from {year_begin} to {year_end} <br> comparing {country_1} and {country_2}", 
        'x':0.4,
        'xanchor': 'center',
        'yanchor': 'top'})
    return fig
```


```python
percent_change_plot("India", "Nepal", 1980, 2020, 1)
```

{% include percent_change_plot.html %}


#### Second Figure
#### What is the change in the maximum temperature recorded for all countries in the world from one year to another?

We query the database to get the temps for all countries for the two years.
```python
import numpy as np
def query_3(year_begin, year_end):
    """
    Returns columns:
    - Country
    - Year the reading was taken
    - The temp reading
    """
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    command = \
    f"""
    SELECT C.Country, T.Year, T.Temp 
    FROM temperatures T
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON C.FIPS = S.FIPS
    WHERE (T.Year = {year_begin} OR T.Year ={year_end})
     
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(command, conn)
    conn.close()
    return df
```

We create a choropeth using geojson file on countries. 
```python
def change_in_max(year_begin, year_end):
    df = query_3(year_begin, year_end)
    max_temps = df.groupby(["Country","Year"])['Temp'].aggregate([np.max]) #finds the maximum temp at each year for each of the two countries
    max_temps = max_temps.reset_index()
    names = max_temps[max_temps['Country'].duplicated()]['Country'].reset_index()['Country'] #since some countries did not have either year_begin or year_end temp readings, we remove the countries that don't have data from both the years, to get the names of the countries for use in filtering below
    max_temps = max_temps[max_temps.Country.isin(names)]
    # max_temps is now a dataframe with a column 'Year' corresponding to the year of the maximum temp, and it has a column with the maximum reading for that year at that country as well. We need to find the difference in max temp between the row of the beginning year and row of the ending year for both countries.
    # example of max_temps: 
    """
    | Country |   Year | Temp 
    | India   |   1980 |  50
    | India   |   2020 |  55
    """
    # so we get arrays for the max temp readings at each year, and find the difference between the two arrays to get the differnece in max temps recorded from begining year to ending year
    begin_max = max_temps[max_temps.Year == year_begin].reset_index(drop=True).drop('Year', axis = 1) 
    end_max = max_temps[max_temps.Year == year_end].reset_index(drop=True).drop('Year', axis = 1)
    diff = end_max['amax'] - begin_max['amax']
    # create a df with countries corresponding to the diff in max temp between the two years
    final_df = pd.DataFrame({'Country': names, "Difference in Maximum Temp": diff})
